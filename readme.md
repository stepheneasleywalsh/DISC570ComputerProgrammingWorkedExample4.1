# 🧮 Algorithm: Decide if a Number is Prime

## Problem
Decide whether a given large number `X` is a prime number.

## Steps
1.	Start with N=2
2.	Check if X can be divided by N, if it can then go to step 6
3.	Increase N by 1
4.	If N=X then say “PRIME” and END
5.	Go to step 2
6.	Say “NOT PRIME” and END
